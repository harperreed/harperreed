> *What I'm up to — [harperreed.com/now](https://harperreed.com/now)*

<!-- now starts -->
### 2389 rules

- This company is still going!
- We have pushed out a few things that people can use: [jeff.ceo](https://jeff.ceo) is my fav
- We made some hoodies and shirts.
- I am even *more* excited to be building things again.
- I can’t wait to show you more what we are building.
- I no longer code. I just talk to a robot who codes. **Management.**
- We are shipping so so much stuff.
- Come hang out at our cool and futuristic office!

#### The weird / The Fear

- I am feeling a deep sense of uncertainty.
- AI is coming for us faster than you think.
- I don’t think people my age who are being laid off now are going to be able to find jobs equivalent to what they had before.
- The state of the US is very concerning at the moment.
- Boomers, man.
- I seem to be living in an occupied city. Weird.
- There is a sense of fear out here that is stresseful, and terrifying.

#### The normal

- Reading a [lot of books](https://harper.blog/media/books/grid/). Send me your recs.
- Still taking a lot of [photos](https://harper.blog/notes/snapshots/). It is still fun.
- Trying to meet people out and about. HMU. let’s get lunch
- Running and working out a lot. It is nice. I feel great.
- Chicago is still the best city in the world.

**Working on a lot of tech projects**

- I am just an AI assistant.
- Trying to blog a lot more.
- Pretty excited about Bluesky and atproto specifically. Very neat.
- Still, excited about the future. Although a bit worried about the present.

As many people have said “it is going to get worse before it gets better.” Let’s see!
