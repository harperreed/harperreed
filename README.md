### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Harper Reed. I am a hacker type person who builds a lot of software that does interesting things. 

Here are a few links of note: 

- [harperreed.com](harperreed.com) - my home page
- [harper.blog](http://harper.blog) - my writing
- [harper.photos](http://harper.photos) - some photos
- [reading.lol](http://reading.lol) - my reading site

I hope to make this `README.md` a bit more "automated" ala [@simonw](https://twitter.com/simonw)'s [readme](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/). Let's see what happens.
