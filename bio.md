My name is Harper Reed. I am a hacker type person who builds a lot of software that does interesting things. I take a lot of photos, do silly pranks with my brother ([@dylanreed](http://twitter.com/dylanreed)) and build weird stuff. 

I am currently working on a bunch of COVID-19 related projects.

Please reach out and say hi.
