My name is Harper Reed. I am a hacker type person who builds a lot of software that, hopefully, does interesting things.

I take a [lot of photos](https://harper.photos), do [silly](http://www.zebraprank.com/) [pranks](https://www.boyhoodhome.com/) with my brother ([@dylanreed](http://twitter.com/dylanreed)) and hang out with my wonderful partner in Chicago.

Currently just playing around.

Please [reach out](mailto:harper@modest.com) and say hi.
