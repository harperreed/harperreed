My name is Harper Reed. I am a hacker type person who builds a lot of software that, hopefully, does interesting things. 

I take a lot of photos, do silly pranks with my brother ([@dylanreed](http://twitter.com/dylanreed)) and hang out with my partner in Chicago. 

I am currently working on a neat project called [Galactic](https://galactic.io).

Please [reach out](mailto:harper@modest.com) and say hi.
