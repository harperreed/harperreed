My name is Harper Reed. I am a hacker type person who builds a lot of software that, hopefully, does interesting things. 

I take a [lot of photos](https://harper.photos), do [silly](http://www.zebraprank.com/) [pranks](https://www.boyhoodhome.com/) with my brother ([@dylanreed](http://twitter.com/dylanreed)) and hang out with my wonderful partner in Chicago. 

I am currently buildfing a neat company called [Galactic](https://galactic.io) (we are [hiring](https://galactic.io/careers/)!). You can always checkout what I am up to [now](https://harperreed.com/now/).

Please [reach out](mailto:harper@modest.com) and say hi.
